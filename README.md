**Project Title:** Machine Learning Project Portfolio

**Project Description:**

This repository contains three machine learning projects focused on different tasks: classification, regression, and clustering. Each project involves analyzing datasets, building predictive models, and deriving insights to support decision-making processes.

1. **Loan Status Prediction:**
   - **Description:** This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant and property metrics.
   - **Dataset:** Property Loan Status Prediction dataset containing applicant information and loan status labels.
   - **Models:** Various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - **Performance Evaluation:** Performance metrics and key insights documented in a Word document.

2. **Sales Forecasting:**
   - **Description:** This project involves forecasting department-wide sales for 45 retail stores across different regions, considering historical sales data and promotional markdown events.
   - **Datasets:**
     - `stores.csv`: Information about store types and sizes.
     - `features.csv`: Data on markdowns and macroeconomic factors.
     - `train.csv`: Historical training data.
   - **Models:** Regression models used to predict sales.
   - **Performance Evaluation:** Results and insights documented in a Word document.

3. **Customer Segmentation for Marketing Strategy:**
   - **Description:** This project focuses on developing customer segmentation for a credit card company to define targeted marketing strategies.
   - **Dataset:** Credit card usage behavior data for approximately 9000 active credit card holders.
   - **Models:** Clustering algorithms used to segment customers based on behavioral variables.
   - **Performance Evaluation:** Documentation of segmentation results and strategic insights.

**Repository Structure:**

- **Classification_Model:** Contains code files and documentation related to the Loan Status Prediction project.
  - `loan_status_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `loan_status_prediction.docx`: Word document detailing model performance and insights.

- **Regression_Model:** Contains code files and documentation related to the Sales Forecasting project.
  - `sales_forecasting.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
  - `sales_forecasting.docx`: Word document summarizing model performance and insights.

- **Clustering_Model:** Contains code files and documentation related to the Customer Segmentation project.
  - `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for data preprocessing, clustering, and analysis.
  - `customer_segmentation.docx`: Word document presenting segmentation results and strategic recommendations.

- **Data:** Directory containing the datasets used in the projects (`stores.csv`, `features.csv`, `train.csv`).

- **README.md:** README file providing an overview of the repository, project descriptions, and directory structure.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.
